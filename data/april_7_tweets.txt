It took nearly a month to confirm the infection, as he's been sick since March 10. He remains in the ICU. It's unknown how he was infected.
H9N2 is typically considered a mild form of bird flu and most cases have been in young children, making this case somewhat unusual. It's also the first known case in Vietnam.
